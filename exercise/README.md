## Welcome to the Python Data Structures Lab!

In this lab, you'll practice working with different data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. By manipulating these data structures, you'll gain a better understanding of how to organize and store data effectively in your Python programs.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create and modify lists and tuples.
- Utilize dictionaries for more complex data storage.
- Iterate over data structures using loops.
- Apply Python's slicing and indexing features to access data.

## Getting Started

- For each exercise, copy the provided code into a new Python script file named `exercises.py`.
- Each exercise includes a function where you will write your code. The function structure helps you focus on working with the specific data structure required.
- Follow the exercise instructions carefully to complete the code.
- After completing each exercise, run `python3 exercises.py` in your terminal to see the output and test your code.

> If you encounter difficulties with the syntax for data structures, review the provided lesson materials or collaborate with your classmates.

Let's dive in!

## Exercise 0: Example

```python
# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to familiarize you with basic Python data structures.
#
# Create a list called `example_list` and append three elements to it. Print each element using a loop.
#
# Requirements:
# - The list should contain any three elements of your choice.
# - Use a loop to print each element.

def example_list_function():
  example_list = ['element1', 'element2', 'element3']
  for element in example_list:
      print(element)

# Call the function and print each element
example_list_function()
```

## Exercise 1: List and Indexing

```python
# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
    # your code here

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())
```

## Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation

```python
# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    # your code here

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())
```

## Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples

```python
# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    # your code here

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())
```

## Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting

```python
# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    # your code here

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())
```

## Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

def list_home_town_items():
    # your code here

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())
```
